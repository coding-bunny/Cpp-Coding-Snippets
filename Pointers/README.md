# Pointers and addresses

This project demonstrates quickly how pointers and addresses work inside the C++ namespace.
The application assigns a random value to an `int`, and outputs the value, the address of the `int`,
and creates `int *ptr` to the address and the value of that.

This gives a rudamentary understanding of how pointers work in C++ applications

## Output
```
           The value of a =               41
         The address of a = 000000592473FB74
       The address of ptr = 000000592473FB98
         The value of ptr = 000000592473FB74
The value at the address is               41
```
