# C++ Best Practices for Developers

This little project contains the coding challenges from the course [C++ Best Practices for Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-plus-plus-best-practices-for-developers)
and my approach to implementing them.
None of this code should be considered production ready, and is a mere means to learning C++ features introduced from the course.
