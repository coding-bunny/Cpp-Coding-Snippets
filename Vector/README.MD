# Vector Example

This example shows how a `vector` works in C++.
A Vector is a container that uses sequential storage to store its members.
Unlike the `stack`, the elements are appended at the back of the vector.

In this example, we will generate a vector with some elements,
append a few more and then simply loop over it to display its contents.

The output will look like this:

```
vector = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, };
```
