# Bitwise Operations

This project performs the explanation on bitwise operations,
not to be confused with logical operations.
Bitwise operations perform logical operations bit by bit on variables, allowing values to sometimes take weird values when mixed up.

The project will simply output information from the code to illustrate the working.

## Usage

The program asks for a number between 0 and 255 (not checked)

## Output

```
Please enter a number between 0 and 255: 100


Binary representations
100 : 01100100
85  : 01010101

Bitwise Operations
a & b (AND) : 01000100
 a | b (OR) : 01110101
   ^a (XOR) : 00110001
   ~a (NOT) : 10011011
```
