# Stack Example

This example shows how a `stack` works in C++.
A Stack is a sequential container that works by using the FILO system: First in, Last out.

In this example, we will use a loop to push 10 elements into the stack, and then simply loop
over the stack, while reading out the top element and removing it.
This continues until the stack is empty.

The output will look like this:

```bash
Pushing 1 into the stack
Pushing 2 into the stack
Pushing 3 into the stack
Pushing 4 into the stack
Pushing 5 into the stack
Pushing 6 into the stack
Pushing 7 into the stack
Pushing 8 into the stack
Pushing 9 into the stack
Pushing 10 into the stack
The number on the stack is 10
The number on the stack is 9
The number on the stack is 8
The number on the stack is 7
The number on the stack is 6
The number on the stack is 5
The number on the stack is 4
The number on the stack is 3
The number on the stack is 2
The number on the stack is 1
```
